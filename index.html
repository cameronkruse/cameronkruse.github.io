Every winter this road is destroyed by avalanches, rockslides and flooding; every spring it is rebuilt. In April 2016 we set out on THIS GREAT GREAT EXPEDITION to answer a question: who annually rebuilds the highest road in the world? To explore this question we documented the individuals as they reconstruct this mountain highway. Here, is their story. ”</em><span>The Highest Road Expedition</span></blockquote>

				<p class="text-intro">Take the High Road, The View Is Much Better.</p>
				<p>When our team arrived in Leh, all of the roads leading to the town were closed for the winter leaving the town isolated from the rest of India. The word on the street was that the road to the west was almost clear. To learn more, our team set out to Zoji La, the last high mountain pass on this route that remained blanketed in snow. </p>
				<p>A few miles outside of Leh, we caught our first glimpse of the Indus River. The glacier blue water had us hanging out of our windows, craning our necks for a better look. This water source has been the lifeline of civilizations for more than 15,000 years. Today, the Indus River is still a valuable water source for both India and Pakistan.
					As we made our way west, every twist in the road took our breath away. Though this particular gorge you could almost see the colorful minerals bubbling to the surface of the sheer rock walls. Does anyone know what types of minerals color rocks purple?</p>
					Soon After Moonland we started climbing high into the mountains. After what felt like the 100th switchback, we crested the high mountain pass of Fotu La. At 13,479 ft. (4,108 m), Fotu La was the highest point of the journey to Zoji La, but surprisingly receives far less snow than other regions west of Leh.</p>

				<p>On our way back to basecamp were blocked several times by road widening operations that blocked the road at particular points. Fortunately, the team was hard at work clearing these snow piles and we eventually made it back safe and sound.</p>
				<p>We stopped for the night in Kargil awaking to the clouds rolling over the high mountains surrounding the deep valley. It’s mountains like these that isolate Kargil, and most of the surrounding Ladakh region, from the rest of the world every winter. As we watched clouds drift by, we made a plan of how we were going to gain permission to visit the high mountain pass of Zoji La that was the last part of the road to be cleared to connect Ladakh to Western India.</p>

				<h2><span class="title-up">Section 2: Pandrass, Ladakh</span><span class="title-down">On the Road</span></h2>
				<p>As we travelled outside of town, we started to notice more and more avalanches that had slid recently. Most of the road, was clear, but started to get a little worried about the conditions.When we Arrived at the road clearer’s base camp, everyone was loading into trucks which would transport them to the areas that needed to be cleared of snow and rubble. You could feel the tension in the air. The workers knew that they were headed into a dangerous avalanche zone.When we showed our permissions to the army captain, he completely ignored them and told us that in no circumstance should we have been granted these permits and we would not be able to go any further; "it was just too dangerous", he said. After speaking for a while, we managed to convince him that we were willing to take the risk. He granted us 3 hours to document the work on the high mountain pass, but we had to promise to be out of the danger zone by 11am.
					Soon after we left basecamp, the road conditions deteriorated. At one point we got stuck and had to clear the road ourselves. Breathing hard after pushing the car and moving a few snow chunks, gave us an appreciation for how hard it is to do manual labor at such high altitude.As the piles of snow on the side of the road grew into towers, our driver became increasingly uneasy.

					<figcaption> Eventually, we set out on foot following the tracks of the workers ahead. </figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>Rounding the corner we found a group of workers ahead clearing an avalanche that had occurred the evening before.Muhammad, Jilon, and Noordin are avalanche spotters. “We sit on this snow bank above the work site looking for avalanches. If we see an avalanche, we blow our whistles. Sometimes this gives the team a chance to get out of the way in time."
					“I’m an engineer for the Border Roads Organization (BRO). I specialize in German built snow clearing machinery."
					Wandering around the worksite we were reprimanded to for walking alone by the military commander. The dangers that unexpected snow could come sliding down from the mountains above was simply too high to risk. If you walk in pairs there’s a higher chance that one of you could rescue the other.
					When the avalanche was finally cleared, everyone quickly jumped on vehicles and headed out to the next avalanche site. Although avalanche danger increased throughout the morning, the workers needed to clear all the avalanche sites before they finished their work for the day.
					We jumped in trucks with the workers and started discussing there day to day experiences as we moved towards the next Avalanche Site.

				<p>We get paid well to do this work [$6 a day], but it is very risky work. These particular 4-5 kilometers are notorious for being an area with many avalanches; I've seen too many avalanches to count. Also, when night falls bears that recently came out of hibernation roam these hills. </p>
				<p>Clearing these roads involves heavy duty snow plow machines that cut a path through the snow and ice followed by snow blowers and us doing manual labor. Currently a path is cleared for the road, we are just going back over it every day clearing the avalanches that slid since the day before. It will likely open in the next few days.</p>
				<p>"One time I carried a man with dysentery on my back for 19 miles through 13 foot deep snow to get treatment. The roads have hugely improved our lives, but the winters here are still brutal - the snow is endless and temperatures here can drop to -76 ˚F (-60 ˚C). Because we're completely isolated from the outside world during winter medical care is virtually non existent during these times."</p>

				<p>"During the summer months we store up food for winter when we are isolated here. The only food that keeps well, are lentils. We've had so many lentils at this point that it feels like we're made of lentils</p>
				<p>"Today I went foraging and found a wild onion and a wild cauliflower. My family will be very happy and proud of me. We have, more or less, only eaten lentils since winter started."</p>
