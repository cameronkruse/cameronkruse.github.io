				<p class="text-intro">Take the High Road, The View Is Much Better.</p>
				<p>When our team arrived in Leh, all of the roads leading to the town were closed for the winter leaving the town isolated from the rest of India. The word on the street was that the road to the west was almost clear. To learn more, our team set out to Zoji La, the last high mountain pass on this route that remained blanketed in snow. </p>
				<p>A few miles outside of Leh, we caught our first glimpse of the Indus River. The glacier blue water had us hanging out of our windows, craning our necks for a better look. This water source has been the lifeline of civilizations for more than 15,000 years. Today, the Indus River is still a valuable water source for both India and Pakistan.
					As we made our way west, every twist in the road took our breath away. Though this particular gorge you could almost see the colorful minerals bubbling to the surface of the sheer rock walls. Does anyone know what types of minerals color rocks purple?</p>
					Soon After Moonland we started climbing high into the mountains. After what felt like the 100th switchback, we crested the high mountain pass of Fotu La. At 13,479 ft. (4,108 m), Fotu La was the highest point of the journey to Zoji La, but surprisingly receives far less snow than other regions west of Leh.</p>

				<p>On our way back to basecamp were blocked several times by road widening operations that blocked the road at particular points. Fortunately, the team was hard at work clearing these snow piles and we eventually made it back safe and sound.</p>
				<p>We stopped for the night in Kargil awaking to the clouds rolling over the high mountains surrounding the deep valley. It’s mountains like these that isolate Kargil, and most of the surrounding Ladakh region, from the rest of the world every winter. As we watched clouds drift by, we made a plan of how we were going to gain permission to visit the high mountain pass of Zoji La that was the last part of the road to be cleared to connect Ladakh to Western India.</p>

				<h2><span class="title-up">Pandrass, Ladakh</span><span class="title-down">On the Road</span></h2>
				<p>As we travelled outside of town, we started to notice more and more avalanches that had slid recently. Most of the road, was clear, but started to get a little worried about the conditions.When we Arrived at the road clearer’s base camp, everyone was loading into trucks which would transport them to the areas that needed to be cleared of snow and rubble. You could feel the tension in the air. The workers knew that they were headed into a dangerous avalanche zone.When we showed our permissions to the army captain, he completely ignored them and told us that in no circumstance should we have been granted these permits and we would not be able to go any further; "it was just too dangerous", he said. After speaking for a while, we managed to convince him that we were willing to take the risk. He granted us 3 hours to document the work on the high mountain pass, but we had to promise to be out of the danger zone by 11am.
					Soon after we left basecamp, the road conditions deteriorated. At one point we got stuck and had to clear the road ourselves. Breathing hard after pushing the car and moving a few snow chunks, gave us an appreciation for how hard it is to do manual labor at such high altitude.As the piles of snow on the side of the road grew into towers, our driver became increasingly uneasy.

					<figcaption> Eventually, we set out on foot following the tracks of the workers ahead. </figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>Rounding the corner we found a group of workers ahead clearing an avalanche that had occurred the evening before.Muhammad, Jilon, and Noordin are avalanche spotters. “We sit on this snow bank above the work site looking for avalanches. If we see an avalanche, we blow our whistles. Sometimes this gives the team a chance to get out of the way in time."
					“I’m an engineer for the Border Roads Organization (BRO). I specialize in German built snow clearing machinery."
					Wandering around the worksite we were reprimanded to for walking alone by the military commander. The dangers that unexpected snow could come sliding down from the mountains above was simply too high to risk. If you walk in pairs there’s a higher chance that one of you could rescue the other.
					When the avalanche was finally cleared, everyone quickly jumped on vehicles and headed out to the next avalanche site. Although avalanche danger increased throughout the morning, the workers needed to clear all the avalanche sites before they finished their work for the day.
					We jumped in trucks with the workers and started discussing there day to day experiences as we moved towards the next Avalanche Site.

				<p>We get paid well to do this work [$6 a day], but it is very risky work. These particular 4-5 kilometers are notorious for being an area with many avalanches; I've seen too many avalanches to count. Also, when night falls bears that recently came out of hibernation roam these hills. </p>
				<p>Clearing these roads involves heavy duty snow plow machines that cut a path through the snow and ice followed by snow blowers and us doing manual labor. Currently a path is cleared for the road, we are just going back over it every day clearing the avalanches that slid since the day before. It will likely open in the next few days.</p>
				<p>"One time I carried a man with dysentery on my back for 19 miles through 13 foot deep snow to get treatment. The roads have hugely improved our lives, but the winters here are still brutal - the snow is endless and temperatures here can drop to -76 ˚F (-60 ˚C). Because we're completely isolated from the outside world during winter medical care is virtually non existent during these times."</p>

				<p>"During the summer months we store up food for winter when we are isolated here. The only food that keeps well, are lentils. We've had so many lentils at this point that it feels like we're made of lentils</p>
				<p>"Today I went foraging and found a wild onion and a wild cauliflower. My family will be very happy and proud of me. We have, more or less, only eaten lentils since winter started."</p>

				<p>During the voyage I often wrote my notes somewhere about midnight, and this night, while thus employed in my cabin, my "stable companion" took it into his head that I was preventing him from the proper enjoyment of his slumbers, and growled out something to that effect; so, to avoid raising his wrath, I interrupted the course of the notes and turned in; but it was not to sleep, for I had scarcely laid head upon pillow before certain sounds from the bunk below made it evident that unconsciously he was going to turn the tables upon me, and that, by stertorously enjoying his slumbers, he would prevent me from peacefully enjoying mine. After several ineffectual attempts to stop the snoring, I at last fled to the saloon, far out of range of the noise, and there reposed in peace for the rest of the night.</p>

				<h2><span class="title-up">Avalanche Zone</span><span class="title-down">Zojila Pass</span></h2>
				<p>On the west side, and near to the north end of the fjord, there are some very fine specimens of common basaltic land forms—two grand corries, a fine dyke, some sheer faces of rock, and as we passed by the end of the land an almost sheer precipice which faced west came into view, while standing out at its foot there was a solitary basaltic column. When coming up the fjord the steam-whistle was frequently sounded in order that we might hear the very fine echoes for which it is noted; the interval is a long one, some three or four seconds. At the corries the sound echoed and re-echoed until it finally died away in the heights above.</p>
				<p>The Icelanders are very hospitable, and travellers are made welcome. Every farmer who can afford it has one or two guest-chambers that are placed at the disposal of any one passing through. On arrival at the farm the traveller is invited to partake of coffee. When this is served in the best room of the house, the farmer and his wife join the new arrivals in a light meal, consisting of excellent coffee, and fancy pastry of equally excellent quality. Some of the Icelandic women are very good pastry-cooks, and the cakes and pastry they produce often equal in quality any that could be procured at a first-class London confectioner's.</p>
				<p>There were some pretty scenes on the river Draghalsá, an interesting stream having a number of hard and soft dykes cut through by the water that descends in a series of waterfalls to a pool, the overflow from which runs into the lake close by. Both pool and stream afford sport for fishermen, and Miss Hastie and Jón got quite a good basket of trout there. I was less fortunate; but as I did not commence until the others had finished, I concluded that they had caught all the fish in the stream and had left none for me to catch—but I am not a fisherman, so lack of skill may have had something to do with the small success met with.</p>
				<figure>
					<img class="js-image" data-pos="0.6" src="img/journey/7.jpg"/>
					<figcaption>At once the music of the steam-whistle was resumed, and our ears were again tortured by its shrill blasts.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>On emerging from the fjord and putting out to sea, we encountered a slight swell from the west, so the vessel rolled a bit; it was really not much, but being the first time during the voyage, it was much disliked by those who were not proof against mal de mer. The clear atmosphere was soon left behind, for we entered another fog bank when only a few miles distant from the land. At once the music of the steam-whistle was resumed, and our ears were again tortured by its shrill blasts.</p>
				<p>Just below the bridge a very remarkable sight is to be seen. For more than half a mile along the right bank of the river a series of cascades and waterfalls flow into it. The water issues from beneath the lava of which the steep bank is composed, and then flows down its side; it is a very striking proof of the great extent of some of the subterranean rivers. Just above the bridge there is a very fine fall in the Hvitá, known as Barnafoss; though fine, it cannot be compared with Gullfoss in grandeur, and the glory of this part of the river is the series of cascades on its right bank. The spot is supposed to have been named from the drowning of two children near the fall—Barnafoss, the children's waterfall; but the minister at Reykholt declared that the tale is not true, and that the name is more likely to have been corrupted from Bjarni, which is a man's name. It is worthy of note that the birch woods seem to flourish best in the decaying lava in the scoriaceous lava-fields; it also seems to do well in soil produced from liparite, for it grows high up on the east side of the liparite mountain, Tunga.</p>

				<h2><span class="title-up">Gullfoss</span><span class="title-down">Above the Clouds</span></h2>
				<p>Gullfoss is one of the sights of Iceland. It is a magnificent waterfall on the Hvitá, where the white water of the river cascades over a series of step-like barriers stretching from side to side, and then plunges finally over a ledge of very hard rock into a yawning abyss more than a hundred feet deep, whence it throws up clouds of spray that are carried hither and thither as the wind sweeps first this way and then that; so thick is the spray, that one's clothing soon becomes saturated on incautiously getting into it. </p>
				<p>Gullfoss is one of the finest waterfalls in Europe, and it is only surpassed in grandeur, if at all, by one or two others in Iceland. We saw the falls at their best, for when we arrived the sun was shining brightly and a rainbow playing over the spray as it rose from the gorge. It is true that the sky clouded over afterwards, and that rain began to fall before we left Gullfoss, but we carried away the impression of the broken waters of the cascade sparkling in the sun, and of the colours of the rainbow playing on the spray over the ravine. The water has carved out a deep gorge in the basalt, and below the falls there are many good specimens of basaltic columns. In the lower part of the gorge there are the picturesque remains of a very fine hard dyke that has a much softer one beside it. These remains are to be seen on both sides of the river, and they have assumed the outline and form of a number of castellated buildings perched high upon prominent peaks.</p>
				<figure>

					<figcaption>Farther on there were many evidences of ice-action: the rounded forms of boulders attracted our attention, as did numerous ice-scratchings on them; some of the outcropping lumps were beautifully rounded.</figcaption>

				<p>Miss Hastie might have had an awkward experience at the spring where she elected to perform her ablutions, of whose periodical activity she was at the time unaware. During breakfast, one of the guides informed us that the small geyser Miss Hastie had been using as her hot-water tap had "gone off." Subsequent experience proved such pools untrustworthy for washing of any kind. A number of handkerchiefs left by themselves to soak were found an hour or two later making their way down an escape hole in the basin, and one that had been entirely absorbed by suction was not returned during a subsequent eruption by the dishonest geyser.</p>
				<p>We erected our tents beside a blue warm-water stream facing the sinter terraces, and as the next day was Sunday, we camped there for two nights. We all took a number of photographs of the terraces and the hot springs, and tried to catch the small geysers when they erupted, as with a few exceptions they did at short intervals; it is true that the eruption was not very violent, and the water was not thrown to a great height, three feet, perhaps, being the maximum.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="img/journey/3.jpg" />
					<figcaption>I had come to this part of the country intending to make a quick survey of it as we traversed it from end to end.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>The next day was devoted to exploring the surrounding neighbourhood, and the different members of the party were struck with different features. Thomas and I set off together. We made for the higher ground, and looked round; we at once saw that we were at the edge of a recent (geologically) lava flow. About four miles distant there stuck up two horns, which we afterwards discovered to be the only prominent remains of the cone of the volcano, Strytur, whence the lava had been ejected. Strytur stands in the middle of the long strip of country lying between, and about equidistant from, the two great ice-fields, Lang Jökull and Hoff Jökull, the area of each of which is roughly about five hundred square miles. </p>
			</section>
			<section class="js-section" data-stay="true" data-zoom-start="1.2" >
				<p>The strip is about fourteen miles wide at its narrowest part (not eight as shown on the existing maps), and extends north and south about twenty-five miles. Strytur is on the divide, or water-parting, between one system of rivers flowing north and another flowing south, and it stands on the highest part of this strip of land. The lava, as it issued from the volcano, flowed north and south down gentle declivities, and spread out east and west almost to the outlying ranges on the margins of the ice-fields. North it extends to just beyond Dufufell, and south almost to Lake Hvitarvatn.</p>
